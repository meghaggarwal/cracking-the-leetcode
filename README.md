# Quick Start

This book contains solutions to the leetcode problems. \
_Why this book?_\
I know many people have already posted repositories for leetcode solutions online.&#x20;

But few of my intentions behind this book was:

* Keep track of work and be consistent.
* Concise explanation and multiple approaches to the problem.
* Keep it as a public work.
* Reference solutions for later.

## Language?

{% code title="test_code.py" %}
```python
if  __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Data Structure and problem solving is language agnostic")
```
{% endcode %}
