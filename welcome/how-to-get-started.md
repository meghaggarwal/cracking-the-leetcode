# How to Get Started?

<mark style="color:blue;">**Find your why to do**</mark>

_There are plenty of jobs in market that do not interview based on DS. I did had 1 too._

Leetcoding was never my cup of tea. I was never consistent, and left things in between.

So, why did I actually want to build problem solving skills all of sudden?\
\
\- I had a good enough reason why should I do it.\
\- Good mentor and resources to utilize.

This was my story.\
\
_Maybe you can also pick up your motivation and reason for investing time, before you feel to give up next time._

<mark style="color:blue;">**Practical steps I follow**</mark>

**Our goal here is to not grind leet code questions aimlessly**<mark style="color:orange;">.</mark> We will focus on quality over quantity, and try to get atmost from each problem<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">step 1:</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>Pick the Data Structure, not just randomly. Ordering matters. It is better to start with simpler data structures and get hands-on with complex ones moving forward.

<mark style="color:blue;">step 2:</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>Read the concepts. I suggest to implement CRUD operations for Data Structure to get better understanding of how it works internally. This would clear your fundamentals and make you more comfortable.  Ex- `Create a linkedlist, add a new node, delete a node, etc.`

<mark style="color:blue;">step 3:</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>This step is the bread and butter of all your work. Take a leap of faith and be patient.

Practise problems. Don't hurry to write code. Write code only when you are clear with your approach. Start with brute force approach first. Later, try to optimize.&#x20;

Slowly, you will develop intutions. You will observe patterns and mind mapping to solutions. You will learn new alogrithms, tricks, patterns and build problem-solving skills which could be used to solve new problems.

<mark style="color:blue;">step 4:</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>Take one step at a time. Gradually increase your level. Reward yourself to be consistent. Peer learning, daily challenge, documentation, teaching are some ways you can do to make this path easier to walk and enjoyable.
