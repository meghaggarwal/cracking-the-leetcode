# How to Get Started?

_There are plenty of jobs in market that do not interview based on DS. I did had 1 too._

#### How did I pick up problem solving?

Leetcoding was never my cup of tea. I was never consistent, and left things in between.\
I needed a very strong why to get it started this time, Luckily, I had few reasons. \
\
_I think everyone should pick up their motivation and reason for investing time. I don't want to bore you, so, let's dive into next section._\

**Practical steps I follow**

Our goal here it to not grind leet code questions aimlessly. We will focus on quality over quantity, and try to get atmost from each problem. \
\
<mark style="color:blue;">step 1:</mark>\ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>Pick the Data Structure, not just randomly. Ordering matters. It is better to start with simpler data structures and get hands on with complex ones moving forward.

<mark style="color:blue;">step 2:</mark>\
Read the concepts. I suggest to implement CRUD operations for Data Structure to get better understanding of how it works internally. This would clear your fundamentals and make you more comfortable.  Ex- `Create a linkedlist, add a new node, delete a node, etc.`\

``<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark><mark style="color:blue;">step 3:</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>This step is the bread and butter of all your work. Take a leap of faith and be patient.\ <mark style="color:orange;"></mark>Practise problems. Eventually, you will notice patterns and mind mapping to solutions. You will learn new alogrithms as you move forward. &#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">step 4:</mark>\
Take one step at a time. Gradually increase your level. Reward yourself to be consistent. Peer learning, daily challenge, documentation, teaching are some ways you can do to make this path easier to walk and enjoyable.\

**Pace**

This journey is a WIP pretty much. I will keep posting solutions as I move forward.  \
I have created multiple folders based on LC question no and will post solutions inside it, picking a problem starting with simple data structure.\
